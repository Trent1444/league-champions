  Annie is a child mage with immense pyromantic power. 
  Even in the shadows of the mountains north of Noxus, 
  she is a magical outlier. Her natural affinity for fire 
  manifested early in life through unpredictable, 
  emotional outbursts, though she eventually learned to 
  control these “playful tricks.” Her favorite includes 
  the summoning of her beloved teddy bear, Tibbers, as a 
  fiery protector. Lost in the perpetual innocence of childhood, 
  Annie wanders the dark forests, always looking for someone to 
  play with.`,

  description: `A traveler from beyond the stars, Bard is an agent 
  of serendipity who fights to maintain a balance where life can 
  endure the indifference of chaos. Many Runeterrans sing songs

  the cosmic vagabond is drawn to artifacts of great magical power. 
  Surrounded by a jubilant choir of helpful spirit meeps, it is 
  impossible to mistake his actions as malevolent, as Bard always 
  serves the greater good... in his own odd way.`,

  makeshift creature reaps fear itself, shattering the minds of 
  those unlucky enough to survive in its wake. Beware the sounding

  human… Fiddlesticks has returned.`,
