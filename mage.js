  description: `Innately connected to the latent power of Runeterra,
    Ahri is a vastaya who can reshape magic into orbs of raw energy.
    She revels in toying with her prey by manipulating their 
    emotions before devouring their life essence.
    Despite her predatory nature, 
    Ahri retains a sense of empathy as
    she receives flashes of memory from each soul she consumes.`,

  description: `Anivia is a benevolent winged spirit who endures 
  endless cycles of life, death, and rebirth to protect the Freljord.
   A demigod born of unforgiving ice and bitter winds, 
   she wields those elemental powers to thwart any who dare 
   disturb her homeland. Anivia guides and protects the tribes 
   of the harsh north, who revere her as a symbol of hope, 
   and a portent of great change. 
   She fights with every ounce of her being, 
   knowing that through her sacrifice, her memory will endure, 
   and she will be reborn into a new tomorrow.`,
