  description: `Raising an eyebrow in the face of danger, 
  Akshan fights evil with dashing charisma, righteous vengeance, 
  and a conspicuous lack of shirts. He is highly skilled in the 
  art of stealth combat, able to evade the eyes of his enemies 
  and reappear when they least expect him. With a keen sense of 
  justice and a legendary death-reversing weapon, he rights the 
  wrongs of Runeterra's many scoundrels while living by his own 
  moral code: “Don't be an ass.”`,
