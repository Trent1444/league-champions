const alistar = {
  championName: "Alistar",
  role: "Tank",
  difficulty: "2",
  tag: "The Minotaur",
  description: `Always a mighty warrior with a fearsome reputation, 
    Alistar seeks revenge for the death of his clan at the hands of 
    the Noxian empire. Though he was enslaved and forced into the life 
    of a gladiator, his unbreakable will was what kept him from truly 
    becoming a beast. Now, free of the chains of his former masters, he 
    fights in the name of the downtrodden and the disadvantaged, his 
    rage as much a weapon as his horns, hooves and fists.`,

const amumu = {
  championName: "Amumu",
  role: "Tank",
  difficulty: "1",
  tag: "The Sad Mummy",
  description: `Legend claims that Amumu is a lonely and melancholy soul 
    from ancient Shurima, roaming the world in search of a friend. Doomed 
    by an ancient curse to remain alone forever, his touch is death, his 
    affection ruin. Those who claim to have seen him describe a living cadaver, 
    small in stature and wrapped in creeping bandages. Amumu has inspired myths, 
    songs, and folklore told and retold for generations—such that it is 
    impossible to separate truth from fiction.`,

const blitzcrank = {
  championName: "Blitzcrank",
  role: "Tank",
  difficulty: "2",
  tag: "The Great Steam Golem",
  description: `Blitzcrank is an enormous, near-indestructible automaton 
    from Zaun, originally built to dispose of hazardous waste. However, he 
    found this primary purpose too restricting, and modified his own form 
    to better serve the fragile people of the Sump. Blitzcrank selflessly 
    uses his strength and durability to protect others, extending a helpful 
    metal fist or burst of energy to subdue any troublemakers.`,

const chogath = {
  championName: "Cho'Gath",
  role: "Tank",
  difficulty: "2",
  tag: "The Terror Of The Void",
  description: `From the moment Cho'Gath first emerged into the harsh light of 
    Runeterra's sun, the beast was driven by the most pure and insatiable hunger. 
    A perfect expression of the Void's desire to consume all life, Cho'Gath's 
    complex biology quickly converts matter into new bodily growth—increasing 
    its muscle mass and density, or hardening its outer carapace like organic 
    diamond. When growing larger does not suit the Void-spawn's needs, it vomits 
    out the excess material as razor-sharp spines, leaving prey skewered and ready 
    to feast upon later.`,

const galio = {
  championName: "Galio",
  role: "Tank",
  difficulty: "2",
  tag: "The Colossus",
  description: `Outside the gleaming city of Demacia, the stone colossus Galio 
    keeps vigilant watch. Built as a bulwark against enemy mages, he often stands 
    motionless for decades until the presence of powerful magic stirs him to life. 
    Once activated, Galio makes the most of his time, savoring the thrill of a fight 
    and the rare honor of defending his countrymen. But his triumphs are always 
    bittersweet, for the magic he destroys is also his source of reanimation, 
    and each victory leaves him dormant once again.`,

  role: "Tank",
  difficulty: "2",
  tag: "The Exemplar Of Demacia",
  description: `Prince Jarvan, scion of the Lightshield dynasty, is heir apparent 
    to the throne of Demacia. Raised to be a paragon of his nation's greatest virtues, 
    he is forced to balance the heavy expectations placed upon him with his own desire 
    to fight on the front lines. Jarvan inspires his troops with his fearsome courage 
    and selfless determination, raising his family's colors high and revealing his true 
    strength as a future leader of his people.`,

    Solari who defends Mount Targon with her Zenith Blade and the Shield of Daybreak. 
    Her skin shimmers with starfire while her eyes burn with the power of the celestial 
    Aspect within her. Armored in gold and bearing a terrible burden of ancient knowledge, 
    Leona brings enlightenment to some, death to others.`,

  role: "Tank",
  difficulty: "1",
  tag: "Shard Of The Monolith",
  description: `A massive creature of living stone, Malphite struggles to impose 
    blessed order on a chaotic world. Birthed as a servitor-shard to an otherworldly 
    obelisk known as the Monolith, he used his tremendous elemental strength to maintain 
    and protect his progenitor, but ultimately failed. The only survivor of the 
    destruction that followed, Malphite now endures Runeterra's soft folk and their 
    fluid temperaments, while struggling to find a new role worthy of the last of his kind.`,

const maokai = {
  championName: "Maokai",
  role: "Tank",
  difficulty: "1",
  tag: "The Twisted Treant",
  description: `Maokai is a rageful, towering treant who fights the unnatural horrors 
    of the Shadow Isles. He was twisted into a force of vengeance after a magical 
    cataclysm destroyed his home, surviving undeath only through the Waters of Life 
    infused within his heartwood. Once a peaceful nature spirit, Maokai now furiously 
    battles to banish the scourge of unlife from the Shadow Isles and restore his home 
    to its former beauty.`,

const nautilus = {
  championName: "Nautilus",
  role: "Tank",
  difficulty: "2",
  tag: "The Titan Of The Depths",
  description: `A lonely legend as old as the first piers sunk in Bilgewater, 
    the armored goliath known as Nautilus roams the dark waters off the coast of 
    the Blue Flame Isles. Driven by a forgotten betrayal, he strikes without warning, 
    swinging his enormous anchor to save the wretched, and drag the greedy to their 
    doom. It is said he comes for those who forget to pay the “Bilgewater tithe”, 
    pulling them down beneath the waves with him—an iron-clad reminder that none can 
    escape the depths.`,

  difficulty: "2",
  tag: "The Boy And His Yeti",
  description: `Once upon a time, there was a boy who wanted to prove he was a hero 
    by slaying a fearsome monster—only to discover that the beast, a lonely and magical 
    yeti, merely needed a friend. Bound together by ancient power and a shared love of 
    snowballs, Nunu and Willump now ramble wildly across the Freljord, breathing life 
    into imagined adventures. They hope that somewhere out there, they will find Nunu's 
    mother. If they can save her, maybe they will be heroes after all…`,

  tag: "The Fire Below The Mountain",
  description: `Ornn is the Freljordian spirit of forging and craftsmanship. 
    He works in the solitude of a massive smithy, hammered out from the lava caverns 
    beneath the volcano Hearth-Home. There he stokes bubbling cauldrons of molten rock 
    to purify ores and fashion items of unsurpassed quality. When other 
    deities—especially Volibear—walk the earth and meddle in mortal affairs, 
    Ornn arises to put these impetuous beings back in their place, either with 
    his trusty hammer or the fiery power of the mountains themselves.`,

  description: `Runeterra has no shortage of valiant champions, but few are as 
    tenacious as Poppy. Bearing the legendary hammer of Orlon, a weapon twice her 
    size, this determined yordle has spent untold years searching in secret for the 
    fabled “Hero of Demacia,” said to be its rightful wielder. Until then, she dutifully

  description: `Idolized by many, dismissed by some, mystifying to all, the curious 
    being Rammus is an enigma. Protected by a spiked shell, he inspires increasingly 
    disparate theories on his origin wherever he goes—from demigod, to sacred oracle, 
    to a mere beast transformed by magic. Whatever the truth may be, Rammus keeps his 
    own counsel and stops for no one as he roams the Shuriman desert.`,

  description: `The product of brutal experimentation at the hands of the Black Rose, 
    Rell is a defiant, living weapon determined to topple Noxus. Her childhood was one of 
    misery and horror, enduring unspeakable procedures to perfect and weaponize her 
    magical control over metal... until she staged a violent escape, killing many of 
    her captors in the process. Now branded as a criminal, Rell attacks Noxian soldiers 
    on sight as she searches for survivors of her old “academy,” defending the meek 
    while delivering violent death to her former overseers.`,

    Claw, one of the most feared tribes of the Freljord. Her people's survival is a 
    constant, desperate battle against the elements, forcing them to raid Noxians, 
    Demacians, and Avarosans alike to survive the harsh winters. Sejuani herself 
    spearheads the most dangerous of these attacks from the saddle of her drüvask 
    boar Bristle, using her True Ice flail to freeze and shatter her enemies.`,

  description: `Among the secretive, Ionian warriors known as the Kinkou, Shen 
    serves as their leader, the Eye of Twilight. He longs to remain free from the 
    confusion of emotion, prejudice, and ego, and walks the unseen path of dispassionate 
    judgment between the spirit realm and the physical world. Tasked with enforcing the 
    equilibrium between them, Shen wields blades of steel and arcane energy against any 
    who would threaten it.`,

  description: `Singed is a Zaunite alchemist of unmatched intellect, who has 
    devoted his life to pushing the boundaries of knowledge—with no price, even 
    his own sanity, too high to pay. Is there a method to his madness? His concoctions 
    rarely fail, but it appears to many that Singed has lost all sense of humanity, 
    leaving a toxic trail of misery and terror in his wake.`,

  description: `A war hero from a bygone era, Sion was revered in Noxus for choking the 
    life out of a Demacian king with his bare hands—but, denied oblivion, he was 
    resurrected to serve his empire even in death. His indiscriminate slaughter 
    claimed all who stood in his way, regardless of allegiance, proving he no longer 
    retained his former humanity. Even so, with crude armor bolted onto rotten flesh, 
    Sion continues to charge into battle with reckless abandon, struggling to remember 
    his true self between the swings of his mighty axe.`,
