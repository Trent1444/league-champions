  Even in the shadows of the mountains north of Noxus, 
  she is a magical outlier. Her natural affinity for fire 
  manifested early in life through unpredictable, 
  emotional outbursts, though she eventually learned to 
  control these “playful tricks.” Her favorite includes 
  the summoning of her beloved teddy bear, Tibbers, as a 
  fiery protector. Lost in the perpetual innocence of childhood,

  description: `A traveler from beyond the stars, Bard is an agent 
  of serendipity who fights to maintain a balance where life can 
  endure the indifference of chaos. Many Runeterrans sing songs 
  that ponder his extraordinary nature, yet they all agree that 
  the cosmic vagabond is drawn to artifacts of great magical power. 
  Surrounded by a jubilant choir of helpful spirit meeps, it is 
  impossible to mistake his actions as malevolent, as Bard always 
  serves the greater good... in his own odd way.`,

  drawn to areas thick with paranoia where it feeds upon 
  terrorized victims. Wielding a jagged scythe, the haggard, 
  makeshift creature reaps fear itself, shattering the minds of

  innovative and esteemed inventors Piltover has ever known. 
  Relentless in his work to the point of neurotic obsession, 
  he thrives on answering the universe's most impenetrable 
  questions. Though his theories often appear opaque and 
  esoteric, Heimerdinger has crafted some of Piltover's most

  tag: "The Ice Witch",
  description: `Lissandra's magic twists the pure power of ice 
  into something dark and terrible. With the force of her black 
  ice, she does more than freeze—she impales and crushes those 
  who oppose her. To the terrified denizens of the north, she is 
  known only as ''The Ice Witch.'' The truth is much more 
  sinister: Lissandra is a corruptor of nature who plots to 
  unleash an ice age on the world.`,

  description: `Luxanna Crownguard hails from Demacia, 
  an insular realm where magical abilities are viewed with 
  fear and suspicion. Able to bend light to her will, she grew 
  up dreading discovery and exile, and was forced to keep her

  life, Malzahar truly believes the newly emergent Void to be the 
  path to Runeterra's salvation. In the desert wastes of Shurima, 
  he followed the voices that whispered in his mind, all the way 
  to ancient Icathia. Amidst the ruins of that land, he gazed into 
  the dark heart of the Void itself, and was gifted new power and 
  purpose. Malzahar now sees himself as a shepherd, empowered to 
  bring others into the fold… or to release the voidling creatures 
  that dwell beneath.`,

  tag: "The Fallen",
  description: `Conflicted between her celestial and mortal 
  natures, Morgana bound her wings to embrace humanity, and 
  inflicts her pain and bitterness upon the dishonest and the 
  corrupt. She rejects laws and traditions she believes are 
  unjust, and fights for truth from the shadows of Demacia—even

  an expansionist nation that reveres only strength. Though he 
  was cast down and crippled in the Ionian wars, his left arm 
  severed, he seized control of the empire with ruthless 
  determination… and a new, demonic hand. Now, Swain commands 
  from the front lines, marching against a coming darkness that 
  only he can see—in glimpses gathered by shadowy ravens from the 
  corpses all around him. In a swirl of sacrifice and secrets, the 
  greatest secret of all is that the true enemy lies within.`,

  description: `Raised in one of Demacia's lesser quarters, 
  Sylas of Dregbourne has come to symbolize the darker side of 
  the Great City. As a boy, his ability to root out hidden 
  sorcery caught the attention of the notorious mageseekers, 
  who eventually imprisoned him for turning those same powers

    between teenage wonder and adult responsibility. She has 
    crossed nearly all of Valoran on a journey to learn the 
    true nature of her growing powers, though more recently 
    she has returned to protect her tribe. Some have mistaken 
    her compassion for weakness and paid the ultimate price—for 
    beneath Taliyah's youthful demeanor is a will strong enough 
    to move mountains, and a spirit fierce enough to make the 
    earth itself tremble.`,

  description: `An enthusiastic master of dark sorcery, Veigar 
    has embraced powers that few mortals dare approach. As a 
    free-spirited inhabitant of Bandle City, he longed to push 
    beyond the limitations of yordle magic, and turned instead 
    to arcane texts that had been hidden away for thousands of 
    years. Now a stubborn creature with an endless fascination 
    for the mysteries of the universe, Veigar is often 
    underestimated by others—but even though he believes

  description: `It is unclear if Vel'Koz was the first 
    Void-spawn to emerge on Runeterra, but there has certainly 
    never been another to match his level of cruel, calculating 
    sentience. While his kin devour or defile everything around 
    them, he seeks instead to scrutinize and study the physical 
    realm—and the strange, warlike beings that dwell there—for 
    any weakness the Void might exploit. But Vel'Koz is far from 
    a passive observer, striking back at threats with deadly 
    plasma, or by disrupting the very fabric of the world itself.`,

  description: `A fiend with a thirst for mortal blood, 
    Vladimir has influenced the affairs of Noxus since the 
    empire's earliest days. In addition to unnaturally 
    extending his life, his mastery of hemomancy allows him 
    to control the minds and bodies of others as easily as his 
    own. In the flamboyant salons of the Noxian aristocracy, 
    this has enabled him to build a fanatical cult of 
    personality around himself—while in the lowest back 
    alleys, it allows him to bleed his enemies dry.`,

    heralding major events that reshape worlds. Her mere 
    presence warps the arcane mathematics governing realities, 
    sometimes causing cataclysms without conscious effort 
    or malice. This perhaps explains the breezy nonchalance 
    with which Zoe approaches her duties, giving her plenty 
    of time to focus on playing games, tricking mortals, or 
    otherwise amusing herself. An encounter with Zoe can be 
    joyous and life affirming, but it is always more than it
